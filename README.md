An analysis of the Powerball, inspired by
[fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/powerball-lottery-jackpot-february-11/),
with additional data from http://www.lottoreport.com/powerballsales.htm
for ticket sales and https://www.wilottery.com/lottogames/powerballhistoryOD.aspx for historical numbers.

See also http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/lottery/ for more information on the statistical
method I am implementing.
